---

### **Project Overview:**
The objective of this project is to develop a parallel implementation of the **Conjugate Gradient (CG) Solver** for solving large, sparse systems of linear equations. The project will focus on utilizing **OpenMP** for shared-memory parallelism and **MPI** for distributed-memory parallelism. The goal is to evaluate the scalability and performance of the parallel solver on various sizes of systems, comparing the performance of the parallel implementation to its serial counterpart.

This project will address the need for efficient solving of large-scale systems in computational science, particularly in simulations involving large matrices, such as finite element analysis, structural simulations, and computational fluid dynamics.

### **Objectives:**
1. **Implement the Conjugate Gradient (CG) Method:** Implement the classical CG method for solving systems of linear equations, focusing on the iterative nature and matrix-vector multiplications.
   
2. **Parallelize the CG Method Using OpenMP:** Develop a parallel version of CG using **OpenMP** to exploit multi-core processors for improved performance.

3. **Parallelize the CG Method Using MPI:** Extend the OpenMP parallelization to **MPI** for distributed-memory systems, allowing for scaling across multiple nodes and handling larger problems that cannot fit into the memory of a single machine.

4. **Performance Evaluation:** Test the performance of the parallel solver on various matrix sizes, comparing the parallel execution times with the serial implementation. Evaluate scalability and efficiency in terms of speedup, memory usage, and the number of iterations required to converge.

5. **Optimization and Tuning:** Optimize the parallel implementation, especially focusing on load balancing, communication overhead, and minimizing synchronization bottlenecks.

### **Methodology:**

1. **Conjugate Gradient Algorithm:**
   - The CG algorithm will be implemented iteratively, solving the equation \(Ax = b\), where \(A\) is a symmetric, positive-definite matrix, and \(b\) is a known vector.
   - The method involves matrix-vector multiplication, vector dot products, and vector updates in each iteration.

2. **Parallelization with OpenMP:**
   - Use **OpenMP** to parallelize **matrix-vector multiplications**, **dot products**, and **vector updates** across multiple threads.
   - Optimize critical sections to minimize overhead and synchronize the results from different threads.

3. **Parallelization with MPI:**
   - Extend the OpenMP implementation to **MPI** for distributed-memory systems.
   - Implement domain decomposition to distribute sub-blocks of the matrix across multiple processes.
   - Implement communication between processes to exchange data necessary for the matrix-vector multiplication and updates.
   - Use **MPI_Send**, **MPI_Recv**, and **MPI_Reduce** for efficient communication between nodes.

4. **Performance Evaluation:**
   - **Matrix Generation:** Test on both synthetic sparse matrices (e.g., random sparse matrices) and real-world matrices from scientific computing libraries.
   - **Metrics:** Measure the **execution time**, **speedup**, and **scalability** as the number of processes/threads increases.
   - Compare results between the **serial version** and **parallel versions** (OpenMP, MPI) to determine the effectiveness of parallelization.

5. **Optimization and Tuning:**
   - Tune the implementation to minimize data transfer overhead in MPI and optimize memory access patterns to improve cache efficiency.
   - Adjust the granularity of parallel tasks and load balancing to ensure that each process/thread is utilized efficiently.
